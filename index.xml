      <description>The Elevator Pitch Transfusion is a VR sword-fighting action game about violence. It takes place in a brutal alien world inspired by a fusion of Aztec and Roman cultures. You play as a prisoner who has to earn their freedom by slaying wave after wave of enemies in gladiatorial combat, as well as utilizing the gifts of a bloodthirsty deity. Along the way, you uncover a story that explores themes of violence, identity and sacrifice.</description>

      <description>The best place to start the story would probably be in December 2021, when I first gave the pitch for a game called VR Slicing Game (working title).
I was pitching for the game to be a “Wolf Project” - the code name for the long form projects taken on by the Video Game Development Club at NC State.
I’ve attached a copy of the presentation here as a PDF, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.</description>
