      <description>The Elevator Pitch Transfusion is a VR sword-fighting action game about violence. It takes place in a brutal alien world inspired by a fusion of Aztec and Roman cultures. You play as a prisoner who has to earn their freedom by slaying wave after wave of enemies in gladiatorial combat, as well as utilizing the gifts of a bloodthirsty deity. Along the way, you uncover a story that explores themes of violence, identity and sacrifice.</description>
