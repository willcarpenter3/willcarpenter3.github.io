The best place to start the story would probably be in December 2021, when I first gave the pitch for a game called VR Slicing Game (working title).

I was pitching for the game to be a “Wolf Project” - the code name for the long form projects taken on by the Video Game Development Club at NC State.

[I’ve attached a copy of the presentation here as a PDF, if you're interested.](/docs/transfusion-pitch.pdf)

It’s actually really fun to look back at this - it feels completely different from what we’ve got now. Especially that mood board! Most of the design pillars for the game have remained intact, though. We’ll talk more about that in a future devlog discussing the design of the game in more detail.

## The Concept

The design I described here was a game largely inspired by the game Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. I’ve actually still got the original page from my game ideas notebook where I wrote down the concept called “Virtual Revengeance” (VR, get it?)

The main mechanics would involve procedurally slicing enemies in arena combat, then gradually leveling up to fighting cyborgs, and eventually humans - and hitting the player with the realization that they’d been trained into being a killing machine - and that it’s fun.

## The Initial Prototype

I had actually built up a small prototype that I refer to as the “Morshu Prototype” as it involved slicing up models of different shapes and sizes including a 3D model of the character Morshu.

A video of the prototype is attached below.

The initial timeline I had proposed was to be done by the end of the following semester, around May 2022.

There's a lot of "I" in the above story, but it's about to be a lot more "We". A couple of friends got on board - Udayan as a senior developer, Ryan as a Junior developer, and Meghan to help out with concept art. We knew we’d need to get more people on the art side eventually but with that team we felt we could at least start.

**To Be Continued…**
