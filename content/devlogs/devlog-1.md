## The Elevator Pitch

Transfusion is a VR sword-fighting action game about violence. It takes place in a brutal alien world inspired by a fusion of Aztec and Roman cultures. You play as a prisoner who has to earn their freedom by slaying wave after wave of enemies in gladiatorial combat, as well as utilizing the gifts of a bloodthirsty deity. Along the way, you uncover a story that explores themes of violence, identity and sacrifice. The game is meant to challenge you both as a player and as a human!

Thatâ€™s what itâ€™ll be to a player, at least. To me, this game is the largest project Iâ€™ve ever worked on, my first big VR game, and honestly a journey about what it means to carry your passion with you as you transition between radically different phases of your life.

## The Team

<aside>
ðŸ“¢ Quick note - these are generic roles, but with a team and game this size everyone has had to do a bit of everything!

</aside>

- Will Carpenter - Director/Project Lead
- Udayan Senapati - Programming Lead
- Meghan Tankersley - Art Lead
- Ethan Smith - Level Designer, Modeler
- Bailey Atwood - Musician, Modeler
- Mitchell Dunning - Modeler, Tech Artist

Some other members who have contributed varying amounts to the project include Nathan Royall, Allison Gutierrez, RJ Washington, Jared VosWinkel, and a ton of friends and family who have playtested and listened to us talk about this project for years!

## The Story

Thereâ€™s a bit of a story when it comes to this project. Itâ€™s been in development for close to 2 years, itâ€™s switched designs, team members, and even engines, and itâ€™s been an absolute blast the whole way.

With the amount that Iâ€™ve learned from working on the game so far, I thought it would be wise to record some of those steps, missteps, and lessons in this devlog series.

**So stay tuned - thereâ€™s much more to come!**
