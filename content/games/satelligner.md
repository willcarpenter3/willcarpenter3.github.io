## Description

In the somewhat time-ambiguous future, the people of the space age
have settled on a new form of communication: the laser-powered
telephone.

Align Satellites, blow up asteroids, and navigate other obstacles to make a connection!

This game was made for the 2021 Southern Student Summer Jam. The theme of the jam was "Transmission."

All assets and mechanics were created or generated by myself.

## What I Did

- Designed and implemented laser reflection mechanics
- Designed level layouts on paper and implemented in Unity
- Created 3D assets in Blender
- Used LMMS to create level music
