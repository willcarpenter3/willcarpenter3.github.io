## Description

A game made for the 2022 Red Storm and VGDC @Â NCSU game jam, where the theme was zombie cats.

You are a cat who was raised from the dead, and now you have to
search for ingredients to make a cure for your zombification. Along the
way you will have to make potions to transform you and use different
abilities to find the correct ingredients.

## What I Did

- Helped finalize initial design ideas
- Coordinated communication between the art, programming, and design teams
- Maintained a Trello board with the current status of each team and their tasks
- Ensured that blocked devs were unblocked as quickly as possible
- (Post-Jam) Reworked the camera system for the rolling cat character controller
