## Description

This is an Augmented Reality (AR) game for Android phones using Unity and Google's ARCore SDK. The concept is that you can design and play a little (or big) tower defense level on any flat surface!

The game started as a project for a computer graphics class with a team of two, and after the class was over we decided to bring another programmer and an artist on board to help us polish it into something shippable.

We ended up releasing the game on Google Play, where it has accrued 500+ downloads to date.

## Things I Did

- Learned how to use the Google ARCore SDK with a Unity project
- Designed and implemented gameplay systems such as "game phases" (build mode, play mode, etc)
- Imported models/rigs made by our modeler and set them up within Unity
- Used the Unity Particle System to create shock/explosion effects
- Maintained a Trello page to help keep the team on schedule for release
